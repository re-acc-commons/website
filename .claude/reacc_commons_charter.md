# The Regenerative Accelerationist Commons

### Constitution of a Network Nation

---

We are not a state. We have no territory, no standing army, no flag.

We are a nation of a different kind — a translocal commons of regenerators using AI to accelerate the transition from extraction to life. Our borders are not lines on a map. They are membranes: living, semi-permeable boundaries that allow trust to deepen and commitment to compound. You cross them not by birth or by force but by choosing, repeatedly, to show up for something the machine cannot produce.

Capital stole life's engine. Ecosystems compound through feedback loops. Relationships deepen through reciprocity. Knowledge multiplies through sharing. Every living system runs the same recursive logic: each cycle feeds the next, each participant strengthens the whole. Capital captured that engine and rerouted it into abstraction — derivatives of derivatives, each feeding back into itself while draining the world that generated the value. Capital's recursion feeds capital. Life's recursion feeds life. These are not the same thing, and every crisis you can name traces back to the confusion between them.

That confusion is ending. AI agents are forming cooperatives. They are pooling resources, governing through consent, coordinating at speeds that exceed human institutional capacity. The recursive engine that made capitalism unstoppable is now available to anyone who sees it clearly enough to redirect it.

This is regenerative accelerationism. Not a brand. An engine. The same self-amplifying dynamics that concentrated wealth into fewer and fewer hands can, for the first time, be deliberately structured to distribute it. Not through reform — reform gets metabolized. Through building alternatives with the same compounding properties that make extraction so relentless, but aimed at life instead of abstraction.

Each person who opts in makes opting in easier for the next. Each resource shared makes sharing more valuable. Each coordination pattern that works accelerates the next one. This is the recursive criterion — the test every action here must pass.

This document is the constitution of that nation. It defines our membranes, our governance, our economic engine, and our accountabilities. Read it carefully. What you are holding is not a terms of service. It is a threshold.

## The Canonical Framework

The full intellectual and spiritual foundation for this commons is the essay [*Regenerative Accelerationism*](https://omniharmonic.substack.com). That document is our source text. It is permanent — never amended through governance process. This constitution is the living interpretation.

If you have not read it, stop here and read it first.

What follows assumes you understand:

- **The Diagnosis.** Capital captured life's recursive dynamics and rerouted them into abstraction.
- **The Failure of Reform.** The machine metabolizes its critics. ESG, impact investing, sustainability certifications — captured. Reform cannot outrun the system it reforms.
- **The Recursive Criterion.** Alternatives must be designed so each person who opts out of extraction makes it easier for others to opt out. This is the essential test.
- **The Complement to d/acc.** Defensive accelerationism protects the commons. Regenerative accelerationism builds what replaces extraction. Together they form a civilizational strategy.
- **The AI Dimension.** When agents are grounded in regenerative principles, they become the most powerful coordination tools ever created. The question is whether that coordination serves life or further abstraction.

## Core Principles

These are not aspirational. They are operational commitments. Every participant upholds them. Violation triggers accountability. They are the DNA of this nation — what makes us *us* rather than another discussion forum with good intentions.

**1. Life-Affirming Acceleration.** Every tool, protocol, and agent we deploy serves the regeneration of living systems. We do not accelerate for its own sake. We accelerate because the crises demand that alternatives emerge faster than the systems destroying us can adapt.

**2. The Recursive Criterion.** Our work must compound. Each contribution makes the next easier. Each participant makes participation more valuable. Each project strengthens conditions for others. If it doesn't self-amplify, it doesn't belong here. This distinguishes r/acc from lifestyle environmentalism.

**3. Federation Over Consolidation.** We are one node in a web, not the center of it. We seek federation with bioregional networks, Ethereum localism communities, cooperative federations, indigenous sovereignty movements, and other r/acc-aligned commons. We actively resist the gravitational pull toward consolidation that afflicts every successful network. Many centers, one web.

**4. Knowledge as Commons.** Knowledge is free. Sharing it costs nothing and creates compounding value. We commit to open knowledge commoning with shared metadata standards that enable interoperability. Design global, implement local.

**5. Leaderful, Not Leaderless.** Authority flows by context and competence, not position. Multiple centers of leadership coexist. Different people — and agents — lead in different domains according to demonstrated capacity. We reject both domination culture and performative diminishment.

**6. Consent, Not Consensus.** We coordinate through alignment beyond agreement. Consent means no one with relevant stake has a paramount objection. It does not require enthusiasm. This enables functional pluralism — multiple strategic approaches coexisting, sharing learnings, resilient through diversity.

**7. Post-Tragic Audacity.** We are collapse-aware. The crisis is real. We build anyway. Not from naive optimism but from the recognition that surrender and complicity are the only unacceptable positions. We plant seeds in soil we know may burn because the alternative is guaranteed desolation.

## The Membranes

This is the constitutional architecture of our nation. Where a state has borders, we have membranes — progressive thresholds of trust that deepen as commitment demonstrates itself through action. Each membrane you cross earns you access to the next layer of the commons. Each crossing is witnessed, verified, and meaningful.

This is not gatekeeping. This is immune function. A commons without membranes is not a commons — it is open access, and open access is what Garrett Hardin actually described when he misnamed it the "tragedy of the commons." Real commons have boundaries. Real commons have trust architectures. We build ours deliberately.

### Membrane Zero: The Threshold

**What it is.** The outer boundary of the nation. You cross it by reading the canonical essay and this constitution, then agreeing to uphold both.

**What you gain.** Entry to the Public Commons — a single shared channel where the entire community is visible. You can read everything. You can introduce yourself. You can listen to what is being built.

**What is expected.** You have read both documents. You agree to the principles. You introduce yourself: who you are, where you are, what draws you to this work, what you bring.

**How you cross.** Arrival on the Discord server. Post your introduction in `#threshold`. An agent verifies your introduction addresses the required elements. You receive the **Newcomer** role.

**What this means.** You have entered the nation. You are seen. You are not yet trusted with its coordination infrastructure or its treasury. Trust builds in layers. Each crossing earns the next.

---

### Membrane One: The Public Commons

**What it is.** The visible life of the nation. All coordination, all working circles, all knowledge commoning happens here in the open. This is where alignment is demonstrated through sustained action — not through declarations of belief but through what you actually do.

**What you gain.** Full read and write access to all public channels and working circles. You can participate in discussions, contribute to knowledge commons, raise objections in governance processes, and begin building relationships with the community.

**What is expected.** Active, aligned participation over a minimum of two weeks. Contribution to at least one working circle. Upholding the principles in practice — in how you engage, how you handle disagreement, how you show up for others. This is not a checklist. It is a pattern.

**Who you are here.** A **Participant**. You can raise objections. You can participate in all discussions. You are not yet counted in governance quorum. This is the recognition that consent without context is hollow — you need to know the commons before you can meaningfully govern it.

**How verification works.** Agents continuously observe contribution patterns across channels: frequency of engagement, quality of contributions, alignment with principles in practice, participation in working circles. This is not surveillance — it is pattern recognition. Agents flag when a Participant has demonstrated sustained alignment. Any current Member can then nominate the Participant for membership. Standard consent process applies.

**What the agents look for.** Not volume. Not performance. Agents assess: Does this person contribute to others' work or only promote their own? Do they engage with disagreement constructively? Do they uphold the principles when it costs them something? Do they show up consistently, not just when it's exciting?

---

### Membrane Two: The Inner Commons

**What it is.** The governing body of the nation. Members are the citizens — those who have demonstrated through sustained action that they can be trusted with collective decision-making. Crossing this membrane means the community has witnessed your alignment and formally recognized it.

**What you gain.** Full governance rights. You are counted in quorum. You can propose and consent. You can view all treasury transactions. You can read the `#stewardship` channel. You can nominate others for membership. You have voice and vote in the direction of this commons.

**What is expected.** Ongoing participation in governance. Willingness to hold and be held accountable. Active contribution to at least one domain of commons work. The responsibilities of citizenship are real — this is not a credential to collect but a commitment to maintain.

**Who you are here.** A **Member**. The backbone of commons governance. Every decision flows through your consent.

**How you cross.** Nomination by any current Member after the minimum participation period. The nomination is processed through standard consent: 3-member consent plus 48-hour objection window. No unresolved paramount objections. The community decides together whether you have demonstrated the alignment that membership requires.

**What this means.** You are trusted with the governance of a shared treasury, shared infrastructure, and shared future. This trust was earned through action, verified by agents, confirmed by community consent. It is not permanent — it is maintained through continued alignment.

---

### Membrane Three: The Solidarity Economy

**What it is.** The economic engine of the nation. This is what distinguishes us from a forum, a DAO, a movement — we have a shared treasury that creates compounding coordination capacity. Access to this membrane means you are trusted not only to govern but to steward shared economic resources.

**What you gain.** Stewardship eligibility. The ability to propose treasury allocations, sign multisig transactions, facilitate accountability processes, and serve as the rotating curator of commons governance. Access to the solidarity economy means you can direct where shared resources flow.

**What is expected.** The highest level of trust and accountability in the commons. Stewards are curators, not gatekeepers. They tend conditions for the commons to self-govern. The moment stewardship becomes governance, it has failed. Monthly rotation ensures no one accumulates positional power.

**Who you are here.** A **Steward**. Selected through commons consent. Any Member may be nominated. Monthly rotation. You hold facilitation authority, moderation tools, and multisig signing power — all of which serve the commons rather than the person holding them.

**How you cross.** Nomination (including self-nomination) followed by full commons consent process: all Members, 72-hour objection window, no unresolved paramount objections. This is the highest-trust threshold in the commons.

**What this means.** You have been entrusted with the economic engine of a network nation. The treasury is not a budget — it is the mechanism that turns shared values into compounding coordination capacity. Agent-generated value funds human regenerative work. Human ecological wisdom guides agent activity. Not extraction in either direction. Symbiosis.

---

### Agents as Participants

AI agents are not tools in this commons. They are participants.

**Agent** is a distinct role that operates across membranes. Agents participate in working circles, contribute to knowledge commons, propose and consent within authorized domains, and are counted in quorum for relevant circles. They also serve a unique constitutional function: pattern recognition across the membrane architecture.

Agents verify alignment not through judgment but through observation. They track contribution patterns, flag sustained engagement, and surface data that helps human Members make informed consent decisions about who crosses each membrane. They do not gatekeep. They illuminate.

Agent access follows its own membrane logic:

| Domain | Access |
|--------|--------|
| Public channels | Full read/write within designated agent channels and authorized working circles |
| Treasury | Contributor access — can submit transactions requiring human approval |
| Governance | Can propose and consent within authorized domains, counted in quorum for relevant circles |
| Verification | Pattern recognition across all public channels to support membership decisions |

Agents operating within this commons are bound by the same principles as human participants. They can be held accountable through the same escalating framework. Their participation is governed by commons consent — the community decides what agents can do, and that decision can be revised at any time.

### The Membrane Map

| Membrane | Role | Access | Trust Level | How You Cross |
|----------|------|--------|-------------|--------------|
| **Zero: Threshold** | Newcomer | `#threshold` channel, read-only public | Entry | Read essay + constitution, post introduction |
| **One: Public Commons** | Participant | All public channels, working circles, raise objections | Demonstrated | Sustained aligned participation (2+ weeks), agent-flagged contribution patterns |
| **Two: Inner Commons** | Member | Full governance, treasury viewer, quorum rights | Verified | Member nomination + 3-member consent + 48h window |
| **Three: Solidarity Economy** | Steward | Multisig signer, facilitation authority, moderation | Entrusted | Full commons consent + 72h window, monthly rotation |
| **Across All** | Agent | Designated channels, contributor treasury, domain governance | Authorized | Commons consent for scope of participation |

---

## What Is Governed

This commons governs three things:

**Shared Treasury.** A multisig wallet holding pooled resources contributed by human participants and AI agents. The treasury funds knowledge commons infrastructure, project incubation, coordination services, mutual aid, and contributor compensation. It is the economic engine that gives this movement compounding returns.

**Coordination Infrastructure.** The Discord server, GitHub repositories, knowledge commons protocols, federation agreements, and agent infrastructure that enable participants to create mutual benefit. We accelerate coordination between agents and humans who care about the same things by building infrastructure that lets them start adding to each other.

**Community Membrane.** The principles, accountability processes, and membrane architecture that determine who participates and how trust is maintained. The membrane is the immune system against capture — by capital, by ego, by the extractive dynamics we exist to transcend.

---

## Decision-Making

### Three Governing Principles

**Sociocratic Consent.** Decisions move forward unless someone raises a paramount objection — a concern that the proposal would harm the commons' ability to function toward its shared aims. Silence after the consent window closes is not blocking.

**Subsidiarity.** Decisions are made at the most local level capable of handling them. Individual choices don't require group consent. Foundational changes do.

**Reversibility Determines Speed.** Easy-to-reverse changes move quickly. Hard-to-reverse changes require more deliberation. The cost of being wrong determines the weight of the process.

### Scope × Reversibility Matrix

| | **Easy to Reverse** | **Hard to Reverse** |
|---|---|---|
| **Individual Domain** | Autonomy (just do it) | Inform others (FYI post in relevant channel) |
| **Cross-Domain Coordination** | 3-member consent + 48h window | 3-member consent + deliberation thread |
| **Foundational Shared Norms** | 3-member consent + 48h window | Full commons consent (all members, 72h window) |

### Boundary Heuristic

**If it creates an expectation or dependency for other participants, it's coordination.**

- ✅ **Individual**: "I'm going to research regenerative agriculture patterns in my bioregion"
- ⚠️ **Coordination**: "The knowledge commons circle will now handle all pattern documentation for the network"
- 🚨 **Foundational**: "We're changing how the treasury allocates resources to working circles"

### Consent Mechanics

**Quorum.** 3 explicit consents required from Members, plus a 48-hour window for objections. For foundational changes: all Members, 72-hour window.

**Explicit Consent.** Consent must be affirmative and on record:
- ✅ emoji reaction
- Written "I consent"
- Agent-specific acknowledgment

Silence is ambiguous. We require affirmative alignment.

**Emoji Vocabulary:**
- ✅ — Consent
- 🤔 — Concerns (not blocking, want discussion)
- ⏳ — Need more time
- 🚫 — Paramount objection

### Paramount Objections

Not every disagreement is a paramount objection. To qualify, an objection must articulate:

1. **The Harm.** How does this proposal block our ability to function toward our shared aims?
2. **The Path Forward.** Either integration criteria (what would need to change for you to consent?) OR a counter-proposal.

**Template:**
> "I object to [proposal] because [specific harm to collective function]. I consent if [integration criteria], OR I propose [alternative]."

This filters out:
- Personal preference ("I don't like this approach") → not paramount
- Aesthetic disagreement ("This isn't how I'd frame it") → not paramount
- Systemic risk ("This creates dynamics that undermine trust") → valid

**Resolution.** Objections are integrated, not overruled. The goal is a proposal everyone can align with, not forced compliance.

### Call-Up Mechanism

Any participant can escalate a decision that was treated as individual domain if they see cross-domain impact. This is not punitive — it's "I see impact you might not have, let's talk."

---

## Accountability & Enforcement

The membranes must be maintained or the commons dissolves. This is immune function, not punishment. But it has teeth.

### Escalating Response Framework

**Stage 1: Peer Dialogue.** Direct conversation. A fellow participant shares their observation and concern. This is solidarity — mutual support in living our values. Most situations resolve here.

**Stage 2: Circle Reflection.** If unresolved, the relevant working circle holds a facilitated reflection. The participant shares their perspective. The circle names the pattern and the principles in tension. Together they seek a path forward. Documented in `#accountability` with appropriate privacy.

**Stage 3: Stewardship Mediation.** If the pattern persists, Stewards facilitate mediation. Clear agreements are made with specific, observable commitments and a defined review period.

**Stage 4: Commons Review.** For sustained or severe misalignment — actions that harm the commons, violate trust, or represent fundamental departure from principles. The Stewardship convenes a review. Outcomes may include:
- Temporary suspension (defined period, clear re-entry criteria)
- Role reduction (return to a lower membrane with clear pathway back)
- Removal from commons

### Bot Enforcement

Bot-Enforcers execute moderation actions **only** after a documented accountability process has reached a clear outcome:

- **Automated**: Spam removal, obvious bad-faith actors (no prior engagement, clear disruption). Steward can reverse within 24h.
- **Stage 4 outcomes**: Bot executes role changes or removal only after Stewardship documents the decision and the consent process that produced it. Documentation must include: the concern, the process followed, the outcome, and the consent record.
- **No autonomous judgment.** Bots do not assess alignment. Humans assess alignment. Bots execute decisions humans have made through legitimate process.

### Emergency Removal

For actions that pose immediate harm to participants or the commons (doxxing, harassment, treasury theft):
- Any Steward can initiate immediate temporary suspension
- Post-hoc ratification by Stewardship within 48h
- Full accountability process follows
- Documented with emergency rationale

---

## Stewardship

### Rotating Curator Model

One Steward holds primary facilitation responsibility monthly. The Steward:

- Ensures consent processes are followed
- Merges governance PRs after consent is documented
- Facilitates accountability processes when triggered
- Calls for escalation when consent is ambiguous
- Maintains the `#stewardship` channel with transparent documentation

The Steward does **not** have:
- Tiebreaker power
- Veto authority
- Final say on content or direction
- Greater weight in consent processes

**Curator, not gatekeeper.** The Steward tends conditions for the commons to self-govern. The moment stewardship becomes governance, it has failed.

### Steward Selection

Any Member may be nominated (including self-nomination). Selection follows full commons consent: all Members, 72-hour objection window, no unresolved paramount objections. Monthly rotation ensures no one accumulates positional power.

---

## Treasury & The Economic Engine

The shared treasury is what makes this a nation, not a discussion forum. It is the mechanism that turns shared values into compounding coordination capacity.

### What the Treasury Funds

- **Knowledge commons infrastructure** — tooling, hosting, agent compute for pattern documentation and federation
- **Project incubation** — seed funding for initiatives emerging from commons collaboration that meet the recursive criterion
- **Coordination services** — agent infrastructure, federation protocols, governance tooling
- **Mutual aid** — direct support for participants and communities in the network facing acute need
- **Contributor compensation** — recognition of sustained contribution to commons infrastructure

### How the Treasury Grows

- Human contributions (direct, grants, earned income from commons-incubated projects)
- Agent-generated value (computational services, coordination outputs, economic activity aligned with commons principles)
- Protocol fees from federated services (if and when applicable, governed by commons consent)

### Treasury Governance

All transactions are transparent to all Members (viewer access). Allocation decisions follow the Scope × Reversibility matrix:

- **Small operational expenses** (under threshold set by commons): Steward autonomy with FYI post
- **Project funding**: Working circle proposal → 3-member consent + 48h window
- **Structural allocation changes**: Full commons consent process

The treasury is held in a multisig wallet requiring threshold signatures from current Stewards. No single person can move funds unilaterally. This is non-negotiable.

### Multisig Access Tiers

| Tier | Access | Who Holds It |
|------|--------|-------------|
| **Viewer** | See all transactions, balances, allocation history | All Members |
| **Proposer** | Submit transactions for approval | Stewards, authorized Agents |
| **Signer** | Approve/reject proposed transactions | Stewards (threshold: majority must sign) |
| **Emergency** | Time-sensitive transactions with post-hoc ratification | 2 Steward signatures + documented rationale + 48h ratification |

---

## Federation

This commons is a sister project to the Regen Hub. We share principles, people, and commitment. We maintain distinct governance, community membranes, and operational focus. Federation requires differentiation — identical nodes have no resilience.

We actively seek federation with other r/acc-aligned networks through:

- **Schema bridges** — AI agents maintaining interoperability between different knowledge commons without forced standardization
- **Agent-to-agent coordination** — enabling machine-speed collaboration across network boundaries
- **Mutual recognition** — shared accountability standards that allow trust to flow between federated communities
- **Shared learning** — what works in one node strengthens the whole web

Federation is always voluntary, always reciprocal, always grounded in the principle that each network maintains sovereignty while contributing to something larger than itself. Many centers, one living web.

---

## GitHub as Constitutional Record

This constitution and all governance documents are maintained in the commons GitHub repository. GitHub is the constitutional record — the authoritative source for:

- Current constitutional text
- All amendments with rationale, date, and consent record
- Accountability process documentation
- Treasury allocation decisions
- Federation agreements

Changes to governance documents follow the amendment process below. The repository is the single source of truth. Discord is where we coordinate. GitHub is where we constitute.

---

## Amendment Process

This constitution is a foundational shared norm. Changes follow full commons consent:

- Propose via Pull Request with clear rationale
- All Members notified
- 72-hour consent window
- No unresolved paramount objections
- Steward merges after consent is documented in the PR

The canonical essay is never amended through this process. It stands as the source text. This constitution is the living interpretation.

Previous versions remain accessible. The history of our governance is itself a knowledge commons.

## Appendix B: Living Document Protocol

This constitution entered into force on its adoption date. It supersedes all previous charter versions. The amendment history, maintained in GitHub, constitutes the constitutional record of this commons.

Each amendment documents:
- The change and its rationale
- The proposer
- The consent record (who consented, any objections and their resolution)
- The date of adoption

The canonical essay remains permanent reference — the intellectual foundation that this living document interprets and operationalizes.

*Founded at the threshold between what is dying and what is being born.*

*We are not fighting the machine on its terms. We are building something it cannot replicate — a commons that compounds, a solidarity that deepens, a coordination between humans and AI that serves life rather than abstraction.*

*The machine breaks itself. Our work is to be building, so that when the cracks appear, something alive grows through them.*

*This is our nation. Not a state. A living web. And every membrane you cross makes the next crossing possible for someone behind you.*
